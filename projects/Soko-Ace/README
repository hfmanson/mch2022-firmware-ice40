;  Snake
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a free interpretation of the classic "snake" game with ASCII art
and a Ledcomm based two-player mode. Enjoy!

The infrastructure is mostly identical with the Forth project,
with Ledcomm logic included (same as in the Ledcomm project)
and with the Pmod lab code replaced by the game.

You need an identical pair of LEDs and two badges for multiplayer mode.

Red, round, clear high-brightness LEDs are recommended,
orange and yellow LEDs should work, too.

Anode:   Pmod pin 1 (P47)
Cathode: Pmod pin 2 (P48)

If you wish, you can open terminal with 115200 baud 8N1 LF to ttyACM1
close the game by pressing ESC and type "chat" to directly experiment
with the optical communication.

Default timing is:

1200 timebase io!  \ 1200 / 24 MHz = 50 us
  24 charging io!  \   24 / 24 MHz =  1 us

You can try the effect of longer or shorter timebase values,
default is 50 us; try timebases between 5 us and 300 us.

Keep in mind that whereas Ledcomm itself offers flow control,
the serial terminal does not and will overrun Ledcomm when
piping data at 115200 baud.

  $1010: RW  Ledcomm Data   Write: Send character. Read: Received character.
  $2010: RW  Ledcomm Flags  [4] Reset (RW) [3] Dark mode (RW) [2] Link up [1] Valid [0] Ready
  $2020: RW  Timebase      in cycles at 24 MHz
  $2030: RW  Charging time in cycles at 24 MHz

Pmod pins 1 & 0 are hardwired for Ledcomm and not available in the Pmod registers.
